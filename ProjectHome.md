THIS PROJECT IS PART OF THE [POLI-LIBRAS](http://polilibras.com.br) PROJECT.

Poli-Libras is a Portuguese to LIBRAS translator, where LIBRAS is the Brazilian Sign Language.

This project provides a Java API to [Jspell](http://natura.di.uminho.pt/wiki/doku.php?id=ferramentas:jspell), so users can enjoy the Jspell features in their Java systems.
